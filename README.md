AI Resume Analyzer 📝

The AI Resume Analyzer is a smart web app that helps you understand how well your resume matches a specific job. You simply upload your resume and paste a job description, and the system tells you how closely they match — just like how companies use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) to filter candidates.

It’s built using AI and modern NLP tools, all running through a simple Python-based application.

There’s also a YouTube tutorial that walks you through how to set it up and how it works.

🔍 What does it do?
📄 Upload your resume

You upload your resume as a PDF, and the app automatically reads the text from it.

📝 Add the job description

Paste the job description of the role you’re applying for. This becomes the 기준 (benchmark) for checking your resume.

📊 Get a match score

The system uses a BERT-based AI model to compare your resume and the job description and gives you a percentage that shows how well they match — similar to what real ATS systems do.

🤖 AI-powered feedback

The AI reviews your skills, experience, and qualifications and gives you easy-to-understand feedback. It uses simple scores and symbols like ✅ ❌ and ⚠️ to show what’s strong and what needs improvement.

🛠️ Suggestions to improve

You don’t just get a score — you also get tips on how to improve your resume so you have a better chance of getting shortlisted.
